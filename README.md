# 🦀 MyRustProject – Expression Evaluator in Rust

This is a Rust-based binary expression evaluator that supports constant and nested expressions with `+` and `-` operations. It evaluates expressions like:

(12.000000 + 3.000000)
((10.000000 + 2.000000) + ((1.000000 + 1.000000) + (2.000000 - 1.000000)))

All of these will evaluate correctly, and also be serialized as properly parenthesized strings.

## 🔧 Features

✅ Evaluate mathematical expressions  
✅ Serialize expressions into string format with full bracket structure  
✅ Handles deeply nested binary expressions  
✅ Custom error type for overflow  
✅ Async evaluation support using `tokio`
